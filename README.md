Title: 
Proving that three qubit error correction of a single qubit has occurred in a simulated quantum system

Abstract:
In this paper it is shown that the bit-flip error correction code corrects an artificially introduced error of a single qubit in a quantum system simulated using Quirk. To prove that error correction has been done it is shown that in the simulation the qubit returns the same state as the one it was initialized in, and second that the mathematical representation of the qubit's states and the gates applied to them corresponds with the simulation.
